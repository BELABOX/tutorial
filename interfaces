# usb0 is normally the L4T virtual Ethernet over micro USB
#
# we disable it by default in the tutorial with
# systemctl disable nv-l4t-usb-device-mode.service
#
# if you have it enabled make sure that:
# 1) you have no other usbX devices as they're not
#    enumerated in a consistent order
# 2) you comment out the usb0 entries below as trying to
#    get a DHCP lease on it will stall
